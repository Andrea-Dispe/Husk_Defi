# My Defi Platform

This is a project I worked on when studying how to use Web3.js and working with blockchain data.

All the contracts I used in this project is taken from (Alpaca Finance GitHub contract repo)[https://github.com/alpaca-finance/bsc-alpaca-contract].

The app tries to emulate (Alpaca Fince DeFi Protocol)[https://www.alpacafinance.org/] in lending, staking and yield farming, though with a much less optimal visual design (I am not a designer).

It connects to the lending, staking and farming pool in currently available in pancake swap and It connects the Metamask wallet to the Bsc (Binance Smart Chain)



#### Tech stack:

- React
- Material UI
- Web3.js



#### To do:

- Implement Redux
- Implement the Trust Wallet
- Fix the automatic switch to the Bsc
